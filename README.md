## simple character name & profile generator. 
made with Gemini 3 (Fast). 
this is a goofy lil project for personal fun and amusement. 

generates a random name from a provided list. 
optionally lists character traits from categorized lists. 

## latest version: 5. 

stable (no obvious bugs). three buttons; shuffle, traits, options. 

shuffle: generate a new name, sans traits.  
traits: generate a list of traits for the current name. it will generate at least one trait for each category.  
options: toggle on/off different flavors of names, and choose how many traits to include.  
name category basic: typical western given names like Mike and Susan and last names like Rutherford.  
name category fantasy: more evocative names like Glade and Harp.  
name category literary: more fanciful or recognizabale names from media, like Rembrandt.  
name category goofy: silly-sounding names like Gloach and Frount.  
trait category physical: describes appearance.  
trait category personality: intrinsic traits that influence behavior. 
trait category habits: things that the character habitually does. 
trait category history: events in their life that could inform their worldview or connections. 
trait category bonds: relationships that the character has with particular people that hold some value. 
trait category goals: objectives that the character wishes to achieve which drive their actions and decisions. 
trait density low: includes only one item from each trait category. 
trait density medium: includes two items for physical / personality / habits / history and one item for bonds / goals. 
trait density high: includes three items physical / personality / habits / history, and two items for bonds / goals. 

todo: 
- add more items to each category so that there are less repetitions. 
- maybe add values trait category, things like "life is sacred" or "
- consider adding / removing categories based on the trait density value. low trait density could include only physical / personality / goal for example.
